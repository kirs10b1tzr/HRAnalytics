# HR Analytics Fundamentals
**Skills: exploratory data analytics (EDA) and predictive modelling (correlations and regressions)**

*In other words, we're going to make data visualisations to better understand the company's workforce. We'll even try to investigate the strength of relationships with mathematical evidence and if any connections stand out, we can try make predictions about what might happen in the future.*

**Steps:**
1. Data Preparation *(Cleaning the Data <-> Forming Impressions)*
3. EDA *(Make visualisations <-> Address business questions)*
4. Predictive Modelling *(Investigating relationships -> Predicting the Future)*
5. Findings *(Fineted visualisations -> Presenting Recommendations)*
